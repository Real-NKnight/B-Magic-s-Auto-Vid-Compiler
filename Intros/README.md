# 🎬 Included Intro Videos

This folder contains 3 professional intro videos to make your UO compilations look amazing:

## 🎭 Intro Collection

1. **CE Blue Rectangle** - Clean, professional blue design
2. **CE Gold Sparks** - Elegant gold particle effects  
3. **Bmagic Fire** - Mystical fire effects (perfect for UO magic themes!)

## ⚙️ How It Works

The script will:
- Randomly select one intro for each compilation
- Automatically trim it to your specified duration (default: 3 seconds)
- Place it at the beginning of your final video
- Standardize it to match your video quality settings

## 🎨 Customization

- Add your own intro videos to this folder
- Remove intros you don't want to use
- Supported formats: .mp4, .avi, .mov, .mkv
- All files in this folder are randomly selected

## ⚙️ Settings

- **Duration**: Controlled by `intro_duration` in config (default: 3.0 seconds)
- **Enable/Disable**: Set `use_intro: False` in config to skip intros entirely
- **Quality**: Automatically standardized to match your output resolution

## 💡 Tips

- Keep intro videos short (2-5 seconds work best)
- Higher quality source videos = better final result
- Consider your video theme when selecting intros
